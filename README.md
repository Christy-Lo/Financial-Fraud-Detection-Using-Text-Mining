- 'data_preprocessing.ipynb' contains code to collect news from Reuter and the data preprocess of a given dataset
- 'Tencent_RE BERT model.ipynb' contains code to implement the github repo of plkmo/BERT-Relation-Extraction (link:https://github.com/plkmo/BERT-Relation-Extraction)

## Acknowledgement
We have refer to different tutorial throughout the project and we do not own the code. The links are stated when their code are adopted. We would also thanks Dr. K. P. Chow's research team for sharing data.
